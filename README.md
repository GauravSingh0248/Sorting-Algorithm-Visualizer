Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
An interactive educational tool to understand, visualize, and compare sorting algorithms in real-time.


🔍 Overview
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a dynamic web application built by Team Algorithm Avengers to help students and developers learn how sorting algorithms work. Users can view real-time animations of various algorithms and explore their performance characteristics.

👨‍💻 Team Members
Payal Maletha – HTML & CSS Virtuoso

Gaurav Singh – Algorithm Analyst & Performance Optimizer

Ritik Bhandari – Front-End Visionary

Saksham Godiyal – Core Coder & Lead Developer

🚀 Features
📊 Visualize 7 sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, and Radix Sort.

🎯 Step-by-step explanation for better conceptual clarity.

🎨 Switch between dark and light themes.

✍️ Add custom input arrays or generate random ones (sorted, reverse, random, etc.).

⏱ Adjustable sorting speed and array size.

📈 Real-time metrics: number of comparisons, time complexity, and execution time.

🧠 Performance comparison across all algorithms in tabular and chart formats.

🧠 Educational Value
This project enhances algorithm learning by turning abstract code into interactive animations. Users gain intuition about time complexity, best/worst cases, and inner workings of different sorting techniques.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (Vanilla)

Chart.js (for performance graphs)
